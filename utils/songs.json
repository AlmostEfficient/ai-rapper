    "lyrics": "Cats can act so peculiar! \nJumping around and playing with strings. \nMaking noises that are quite peculiar. \nJust being down right silly things. \nStealing food, scratching furniture! \nBehaviors that make them so obscure. \nMaking us just have to endure. Laughs, smiles and purrs to the core. \nThey lay around like lions in the sun! \nTill they hear the sound of their dinner bell. \nA sudden burst of energy thatâ€™s fun. A transformational spell."

It's knowledge that you can use. \nYou'll be able to understand. And you'll know that it's true. \nI'm gonna be your teacher! I'm gonna show you how to think. \nYou'll be able to see the world. In a way you've never seen."

I finally feel alive. \nI'm gettin' the right amount of sleep. \nWhat a relief, it's hard to believe.\nMy bed's like a dream, I'm livin' right! \nI take a nap, the world is in sight. My energy is high, I'm ready to move. \nMy rest was so strong, I'm feelin' so smooth."
